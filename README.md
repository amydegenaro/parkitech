# Parkitech

_A geogtagged ticket board for park management_

## Background

Parkitech was created to fill a technology gap often found in small non-profits managing public parks and spaces. Maintenance and Park Ranger teams work both in the field and the office and need a good way to track and record tasks or issues from both places at once. Parkitech is a ticket board with a responsive interface for use on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Tickets are geotagged to record and plot their exact coordinates on a map, allowing for better tracking, organization, and analytics of park operations.

## Built With

Parkitech was originally built as a 4-day hackathon project for my Grace Hopper program. It was built using Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, React, Redux, and Mapbox.

## Installation

Fork and clone this repository, install dependencies with `npm install`, and then `npm run start-dev` to start a local development environment.
